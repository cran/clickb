Description: Designed for web usage data analysis, it implements tools to process web sequences and identify web browsing profiles through sequential classification. Sequences' clusters are identified by using a model-based approach, specifically mixture of discrete time first-order Markov models for categorical web sequences. A Bayesian approach is used to estimate model parameters and identify sequences classification as proposed by Fruehwirth-Schnatter and Pamminger (2010) <doi:10.1214/10-BA606>.
